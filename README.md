## How It's Made:
Nothing fancy here just a simple background image with another image sized with CSS and JS to make the image move.


**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Lessons Learned:
This was my first experience of successfully coding something that worked. That "WHOA" moment where I felt like I had solidified myself as a Developer.
